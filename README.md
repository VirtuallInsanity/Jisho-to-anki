# How to get Jisho urls
You can use this extension: https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/odclbaijmmabcgcdaipkpkcmfkfifgea?utm_source=item-share-cb <br/>
Or you can use any other method that suits you, but the format of .txt should be the same. <br/>

**Important:** Words in the links should only be written with __kanji__ <br/>
**For example:** The link sould be pointing to the word written this way **付ける** and not this way **つける**
